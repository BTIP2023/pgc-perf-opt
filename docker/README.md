# Docker Guide
This directory . will contain the separate .Dockerfiles used to build isolated
environments for each research objective, including extended objectives.

Subdirectories will contain auxiliary files which were copied directly from 
the **rocker-org (n.d.)** reference repository.

This will resolve all dependency issues brought up in `code/README.md`.

## Notes
Under consideration is the Conda platform for managing dev environments.
