## GISAID Accession Numbers
For data obtained from GISAID, only accession numbers will be included in this and the root README files.

**Reason (GISAID, 2012)**

> GISAID does not promote the release of data to databases where access to data is anonymous and the rights of the submitter are relinquished.  GISAID already provides the public with open access to data in a transparent way.
